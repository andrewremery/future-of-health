           <p>In Loving Memory of Marvin Minsky
Professor Marvin Minsky is one of the founders of the field of Artificial Intelligence and one of the greatest scientists and thinkers on our times – a symbol of creativity and innovation. He was a great mentor to many students. Marvin Minsky has made many contributions to AI, cognitive psychology, mathematics, computational linguistics, robotics, and optics. In recent years he has worked chiefly on imparting to machines the human capacity for commonsense reasoning. His conception of human intellectual structure and function is presented in The Society of Mind which is also the title of the course at MIT. He received a BA and PhD in mathematics at Harvard and Princeton. In 1951, he built the SNARC, the first neural network simulator. His other inventions include mechanical hands and other robotic devices, the confocal scanning microscope, the “Muse” synthesizer for musical variations (with E. Fredkin), and the first LOGO “turtle” (with S. Papert). A member of the NAS, NAE and Argentine NAS, he has received the ACM Turing Award, the MIT Killian Award, the Japan Prize, the IJCAI Research Excellence Award, the Rank Prize and the Robert Wood Prize for Optoelectronics, and the Benjamin Franklin Medal. We are grateful for his participation in Future of Health Technology Summits since 1996 and his commitment to look for breakthrough technologies improving health. He is the first recipient of the FHTI Future of Health Technology Award in 1998. At FHTI’s 20th Future of Health Technology Summit we will remember, honor and build upon his scientific work. He will be greatly missed.</p>

His favourite topic is pushing back the frontiers of machine intelligence.
Kevin began his career by joining British Telecom.   At age 22 he took his first degree at Aston University followed by a PhD and research post at Imperial College, London.
He subsequently held positions at Oxford, Newcastle and Warwick Universities before being offered the Chair at Reading, at the age of 32.
Kevin has published over 350 research papers and his paperback “In the Mind of the Machine” gives a warning of a future in which machines are more intelligent than humans.
He has been awarded higher doctorates both by Imperial College and the Czech Academy of Sciences. He has been described by Gillian Anderson of the X-Files as Britain’s leading prophet of the robot age.
He appears in the 1999 Guinness Book of Records for an Internet robot learning experiment.  In 1998 he had a silicon chip transponder surgically implanted in his left arm and then performed series of further implant experiments linking Kevin’s nervous system to a computer.  This research led to him being featured in February 2000, as the cover story on the US magazine “Wired”. He received the Future Health Technology Award in the year 2000.</p>
