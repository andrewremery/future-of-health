            	Professor Marvin Minsky is one of the founders of the field of Artificial
Intelligence and one of the greatest scientists and thinkers on our times – a symbol
of creativity and innovation. He was a great mentor to many students. Marvin
Minsky has made many contributions to AI, cognitive psychology, mathematics,
computational linguistics, robotics, and optics. In recent years he has worked
chiefly on imparting to machines the human capacity for commonsense reasoning.
His conception of human intellectual structure and function is presented in The
Society of Mind which is also the title of the course at MIT. He received a BA and
PhD in mathematics at Harvard and Princeton. In 1951, he built the SNARC, the
first neural network simulator. His other inventions include mechanical hands and
other robotic devices, the confocal scanning microscope, the “Muse” synthesizer
for musical variations (with E. Fredkin), and the first LOGO “turtle” (with S. Papert).
A member of the NAS, NAE and Argentine NAS, he has received the ACM Turing
Award, the MIT Killian Award, the Japan Prize, the IJCAI Research Excellence
Award, the Rank Prize and the Robert Wood Prize for Optoelectronics, and the
Benjamin Franklin Medal. We are grateful for his participation in Future of Health
Technology Summits since 1996 and his commitment to look for breakthrough
technologies improving health. He is the first recipient of the FHTI Future of Health
Technology Award in 1998. At FHTI’s 20th Future of Health Technology Summit we
will remember, honor and build upon his scientific work. He will be greatly missed.
